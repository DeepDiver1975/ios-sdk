	Sync Issue Queue:

	# New Sync Issue:
	1) Sync Engine hands over issues to -handleSyncIssue:
	2) -handleSyncIssue:
		a) checks if the sync issue has already been enqueued
			- if not, enqueues the issue
			- otherwise
		b) checks if the OCCore.delegate implements OCCoreIssueQueueHandlingDelegate - and if it does:
			- adds the sync issue to the queue
			- notifies the OCCoreIssueQueueHandlingDelegate of the new issue
		c) if not, checks if there is an OCCore.delegate:
			- sends the sync issue as OCIssue to the OCCoreDelegate error/issue handling method
			- keeps the core alive until the issue receives a response or the OCIssue's enqueue handler is called
		d) if not, tries to respond to the the issue in a non-destructive way
